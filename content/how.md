### Servers, Guardians, Users and Passwords

With our distributed key derivation algorithm each time a user wants to access his data, his personal key gets reconstructed. To accomplish this he needs to prove to every guardian that he indeed has access to his password. Because of this requirement even if all guardians but one are compromised, the data stays secure. The guardians function in way as trustless access control systems.

TPHE is variant of out Technology that allows flexible amount of guardians to work in consenus. For example you can set up that you need to contact 10 out of 20 guardians to be able to reconstruct the key.
